Data Structure: A way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

Data Structure define the layout of data in memory and help improve the performance of operations like searching, sorting
and inserting.

Ex: Array, LinkedList, Trees, Graphs.

Algorithms: A finite sequence of well defined instructions to solve a problem.
Algorithms are focussed on optimising time and space complexity.

Ex: Searching, Sorting.

Why DSA?
Optimisation.
