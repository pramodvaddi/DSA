BigO is a way of comparing tw sets of code.

How did you compare? Mathematically how efficient they run.

Time Complexity: Not measured in time. Measured in number of operations.

Space Complexity: Preserving memory space.

Dealing with Time and Space Complexity
1. Omega  2.Theta 3.Omicron O

Omega: Best Case
Theta: Average Case
Omicron: Worst Case.

There is nothing like Average Case BigO and best case BigO. Average case is Theta, and the the best case is Omega.
Technically, BigO is always worst case.

O(n):
